如何设置odoo会计?
=============================

The Odoo Accounting application has an implementation guide that you
should follow to configure it. It's a step-by-step wizard with links to
the different screens you will need.

Once you have `installed the Accounting
application <https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/online/account_accountant/>`__,
you should click on the top-right progressbar to get access to the
implementation guide.
